# IoT-Based Health Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based health monitoring system where I developed firmware and established communication between a microcontroller and a WiFi module to transmit sensor data to a specific website. The project uses Arduino software for firmware development and an AVR controller to gather sensor data. By implementing UART communication, I ensured seamless data transfer between the microcontroller and the WiFi module (ESP8266).

## Project Overview
The aim of this project was to create a health monitoring system that could collect data from various sensors and send it to a designated website for further analysis. Here's a summary of the key components and their functions:

- **AVR Microcontroller**: The heart of the system, responsible for collecting data from sensors and communicating with the WiFi module.
- **Sensors**: A variety of sensors were used to gather health-related data (e.g., heart rate, temperature, etc.).
- **WiFi Module (ESP8266)**: This module established wireless communication with a specific website, allowing data to be transmitted remotely.
- **UART Communication**: Implemented to facilitate communication between the AVR microcontroller and the WiFi module.

## Design Process
The following steps outline the development process for this IoT-based health monitoring system:

1. **Firmware Development**: I wrote the firmware using Arduino software to control the AVR microcontroller. This involved configuring the microcontroller to read sensor data and send it to the WiFi module.
2. **UART Communication**: I set up UART communication to establish a reliable connection between the microcontroller and the WiFi module.
3. **WiFi Configuration**: I configured the ESP8266 WiFi module to connect to a specified network and send data to a designated website.
4. **Sensor Integration**: The sensors were connected to the microcontroller, and the firmware was designed to collect and process their data.
5. **Data Transmission**: The system was set up to send sensor data to a specific website for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Challenges and Solutions
During the project, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **UART Configuration**: Ensuring proper configuration and synchronization for reliable data transfer between the microcontroller and WiFi module.
- **Sensor Calibration**: Correctly calibrating sensors to ensure accurate data collection.
- **Network Connectivity**: Maintaining a stable WiFi connection for consistent data transmission.

I overcame these challenges through careful debugging, rigorous testing, and fine-tuning of the firmware and hardware components.

## Outcomes
The project successfully created an IoT-based health monitoring system that collected data from sensors and transmitted it wirelessly to a website. This provided a foundation for remote health monitoring and data analysis. The system demonstrated reliable communication between the AVR microcontroller and the WiFi module, along with seamless integration of various sensors.

## Learning and Future Improvements
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in firmware development, UART communication, and wireless data transmission. For future improvements, I plan to:

- Integrate additional sensors to expand the system's capabilities.
- Explore other communication protocols like SPI and I2C for improved data transfer.
- Optimize the firmware for greater efficiency and lower power consumption.
- Develop a more robust website or mobile application for enhanced data visualization and analysis.
